            This is web page is developed in <span> Angular, React, Vue </span> and <span>webComponents</span>. Host application is in <span>Angular</span>
            and different components are developed in different libraries.<br/><br/><i>Check the below image for clear picture.</i>

        <p>
            I used <span class="nx"> Nx monorepo </span> for this mashup. The main application is in <span>Angular</span> and created libraries for <span> Angular, React</span> and <span>Web components.</span>
            Since <span class="nx">Nx</span> is yet to add support for vue components, I created a vue component in host app it self and rendering it after converted into a web component.
            Host application (i.e, Angular) is passing data to other components as @Inputs() (to Angular components) or as props (to react and vue).<br/><br/>

            Images and styles are added in Assets Library which is shared across all libraries and host application.
            <br/><br/>
            And this application is hosted in <span>AWS</span>
