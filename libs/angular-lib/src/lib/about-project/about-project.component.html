        I used <span> Angular, React, Vue </span> and <span>webComponents</span> to develop this web page. Host application is in <span>Angular</span>
        and different components are developed in different libraries. And this application is hosted in <span>AWS</span>.<br/><br/><i>Please check below image for clear picture.</i>

        I used <span class="nx"> Nx monorepo </span> for this mashup. The main application is in Angular and created libraries for <span> Angular, React</span> and <span>Web components.</span>
        Since <span class="nx">Nx</span> is yet to add support for vue components, I create a vue component in host app and converted into web component and rendering it.
        Host application (i.e, Angular) is passing data to other components as @Inputs() (to Angular components) or as props (to react and vue)
