This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

 <p>
            This is web page is developed in <span> Angular, React, Vue </span> and <span>webComponents</span>. Host application is in <span>Angular</span>
            and different components are developed in different libraries.<br/><br/><i>Check the below image for clear picture.</i>

 <p>
            I used <span class="nx"> Nx monorepo </span> for this mashup. The main application is in <span>Angular</span> and created libraries for <span> Angular, React</span> and <span>Web components.</span>
            Since <span class="nx">Nx</span> is yet to add support for vue components, I created a vue component in host app it self and rendering it after converted into a web component.
            
            Host application (i.e, Angular) is passing data to other components as @Inputs() (to Angular components) or as props (to react and vue).
</p>
<p>
            Images and styles are added in Assets Library which is shared across all libraries and host application.
            <br/><br/>
            And this application is hosted in <span>AWS</span>

## Quick Start & Documentation

<h3>MonoRepos</h3>

<section>

A monorepo (mono repository) is a single repository that stores all of your code and assets for every project.

Using a monorepo is important for many reasons. It creates a single source of truth. It makes it easier to share code. It even makes it easier to refactor code.

## Run Project

Run `nx serve ng --port 4400` to run the project and open http://localhost:4400/

ng is the name of host application which i created in Angular. Hence the name is ng.

A /dist folder is created at root folder and deploy this content anywhere.

## To see Dep Graph
Run `nx dep-graph` to view the dependencies of libraries

## Few More useful Commands 

<h4>Create new application in Angular</h4>

`ng generate @nrwl/angular:application <--App Name-->`

<h4>Create new application in React</h4>

`ng generate @nrwl/react:application <--App Name-->`

<h4>Creating angular library with publishable</h4>

`npx nx g @nrwl/angular:lib <--Library Name--> --publishable --importPath ng-components`

<h4>Creating react library with publishable</h4>

`npx nx g @nrwl/react:lib <--Library Name--> --publishable --importPath react-components`


<b>NOTE:</b> We can publish these libraries to npm as an artifact.

<h4>Creating Shared Assets Library</h4>

`nx g @nrwl/web:lib <--Library Name--> â€”directory=shared `

<b>NOTE:</b> Keep all your styles and images in this folder and this can be shared across all liraries and applications.
